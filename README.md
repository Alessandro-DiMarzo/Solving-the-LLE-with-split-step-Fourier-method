# Solving-the-LLE-with-split-step-Fourier-method
We implement a numerical solution to the dimensionless LLE using the Split-Step Fourier Method (SSFM) and second order Runge-Kutta integration for better efficiency. The simulation explores the formation of dissipative Kerr solitons and their stability under varying detuning.
